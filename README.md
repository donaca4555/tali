# Telmo's Arch Linux Installer

## **ATTENTION: This script is not ready for use**

## Setup

First of all, boot your [Arch Linux live CD](https://www.archlinux.org/download/).

You'll need an internet connection to user this script, if you need to use Wi-Fi type `iw dev` to find your Wi-Fi interface name and then `wifi-menu -o INTERFACE_NAME` to connect.

Then, download the script and run it:

```
wget -b https://raw.githubusercontent.com/telmotrooper/arch-linux/master/install.py && python install.py
```
